# Parallel-Sudoku-Solver
A parallel approach to solve NxN sudokus on multiple hosts

== SUPER IMPORTANT NOTES ==

Grids are indexed from 0. So the top left element of a puzzle object is at row = 0 col = 0.
The bottom right element is at row = 8 col = 8

Also, undefined cells on the grid have value -1. Let's use this convention while coding!
